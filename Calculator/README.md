# Calculator App

## Overview
The Calculator App is a beginner-friendly Python project designed to perform basic arithmetic operations through a menu-driven interface.  
This project helps beginners practice fundamental programming concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, and error handling.  

The calculator allows users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and power calculations. The program also includes input validation and error handling to prevent crashes, such as division by zero or invalid inputs.

## How It Works
1. When the program runs, it displays a menu with the available operations.
2. The user selects an operation by entering a number corresponding to the choice.
3. The program prompts the user to enter two numbers.
4. It performs the selected operation and displays the result.
5. The program loops back to the menu, allowing multiple calculations until the user chooses to exit.
